Reasoning and Design Philosophy
The provided document outlines a five-phase workflow for clipping videos from Whop.com. My goal is to translate this conceptual guide into functional, automated workflows for both n8n and Node-RED.
The core logic is:
Trigger: Receive a request containing the video URL, start time, and end time.
Download: Fetch the source video file.
Process: Use the command-line tool FFmpeg to cut the video. This is the most robust and universal method, as suggested in the document.
Upload: Send the newly clipped video to its destination.
I will implement the "Preferred" or "Manual" options from the document (Webhook trigger, manual time inputs) as they form the most common and direct use case for building a reusable automation. The more advanced AI-driven and polling options can be built on top of this core foundation.

1. n8n Workflow
 n8n excels at handling binary files between nodes, making the process relatively straightforward.

Step-by-Step Breakdown (n8n)
Webhook Node (Trigger): This node acts as the entry point, corresponding to Phase 1 (Option A) and Phase 3 (Option A). It's configured to listen for POST requests. It expects a JSON body with video_url, start_time, and end_time to be sent to its test/production URL.
HTTP Request Node (Download Video): This node fulfills Phase 2. It takes the video_url from the Webhook node and downloads the video. Crucially, the Response Format is set to File so n8n handles the binary data and saves it to a temporary file for the next step.
Execute Command Node (Process Video): This is the core of Phase 4. It runs an FFmpeg command.
Command: ffmpeg -i ./{{$binary.data.fileName}} -ss {{$json.start_time}} -to {{$json.end_time}} -c copy output.mp4
This command uses expressions to dynamically insert the filename of the downloaded video ({{$binary.data.fileName}}) and the start/end times from the trigger ({{$json.start_time}}, {{$json.end_time}}).
Note: This requires ffmpeg to be installed in the n8n environment (or using a Docker image that includes it).
HTTP Request Node (Upload Video): This node handles Phase 5. It simulates uploading the final clip to a destination API.
It's configured to send a POST request.
The Body Content Type is set to Multipart/Form-Data.
It sends the binary output from the Execute Command node by referencing the output.mp4 file in the "Send Binary File" section.
